MP3Trigger by David Wicks

Simple wrapper for MP3Trigger serial communication from Arduino.
Also allows you to loop tracks.

You need to place MP3Trigger in the right place on your machine
for Arduino libraries. On a Mac, that means MP3Trigger.h and
MP3Trigger.cpp live inside:
~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/MP3Trigger

For sample usage, see the examples/ folder (courtesy Carl Jensen)
